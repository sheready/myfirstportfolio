<h3>About me</h3>
<div id="about">
<p>I am a feminist,entrepreneur,mathematician and a tech enthusiast.</p>
<p>5 things to know about me:</p>
<ol id="me">
    <li>I am a pieces.</li>
    <li>I am African.</li>
    <li>I aspire to solve a challenge faced by poor communities using tech.</li>
    <li>Reggae,hiphop,90's music and afrobeats are my life rhythms. </li>
    <li>Spiritual growth is major key.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have ventured into different businesses for five years.I have been able to employ upto three casual labourers simultaneously.I eventually intend to own multinational and global companies and employ thousands of people.</p>
<p>I prefer studying online than the classroom set up,hence I study and research alot of knowledge on my own.I have completed my primary and secondary studies.</p>
<p>I decided to take up a class in programming since I realised I know alot of computing concepts apart from practically being able to develop a project that required programming skills from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Another reason I wanted to join a programming class is after realising a business would be really successful with a good system to support it. </p>
<p>Hobbies I choose to enjoy after COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<ol id="me">
<li>Mountain climbing</li>
<li>Nature walks</li>
<li>Local Tourism</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Reading novels</li>
</ol>
